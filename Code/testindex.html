    <strong>Background</strong>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is a technology entrepreneur, investor, and engineer.[4][5][6]
        He holds South African, Canadian, and U.S. citizenship and is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer/designer of
        SpaceX;[7] co-founder, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;[8] co-founder of Neuralink; founder of The
        Boring Company;[9] co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI;[10] and co-founder of PayPal. In December 2016,
        he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People. He has a net worth of $19.4 billion
        and is listed by Forbes as the 40th-richest person in the world.

        Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He
        transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a Bachelor's degree in
        economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He
        began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two
        days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. He subsequently co-founded Zip2, a web software company, which was
        acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity
        in 2000 and later that year became PayPal, which was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.
        In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is
        CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was
        founded,[12] and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of SolarCity, a solar
        energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla) and operated as its chairman. In 2015, Musk co-founded
        OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he
        co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces. In December
        2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company.
        In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as
        the Hyperloop, and has proposed a vertical take-off and landing supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric
        fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.[16] Musk has stated that the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and
        SolarCity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[17] His goals include reducing global
        warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of human extinction by
        establishing a human colony on Mars.</p>

    <strong>Early life</strong>
    <hr />
    <p style="color: blue; background-color:lightcyan;font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[19] the son of Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a
        model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[20] and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical
        engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born
        1974).[24] His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[25][26] His paternal
        grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[27][28] After his parents divorced in
        1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[27] which Musk chose two years after his
        parents split up, but now Musk says it was a mistake.[29] As an adult, Musk has severed relations with his
        father, whom he has referred to as "a terrible human being".[29] He has a half-sister[30] and a
        half-brother.[31]
        During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[32] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with
        the Commodore VIC-20.[33] He taught himself computer programming at the age of 10, and by the age of 12 sold the
        code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar, to a magazine called PC and Office Technology, for
        approximately $500.[34][35] A web version of the game is available online.[34][36] His childhood reading
        included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that "you should try to take the set of
        actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of
        a dark age if there is one".[29]
        Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down
        a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness.[29] He later
        revealed that he had to get a nose job to repair the damage.[32][37]
        Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School[37] before graduating from Pretoria
        Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to
        move to the United States. As he states, "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are
        possible, more than any other country in the world."[38] Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States
        from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday,[39]
        after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother</p>

    <strong>Education</strong>
    <hr />
    <p>At the age of 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen's University, avoiding mandatory service in the
        South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; he
        graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor's degree in
        physics.[43][44]

        After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However,
        his move coincided with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part
        of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation</p>
